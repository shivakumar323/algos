/*MAXIMISE THE ONE
Problem Statement You are given a string S composed only of 1 and 0. In one operation you can flip any character of the string. Flipping means changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

If you can do this operation at most M times, find the maximum consecutive 1’s that you can get.

Constraints 1 <= | S | <= 105 1 <= M <= 105

Input Format First-line contains an integer M. Second line contains a string S.

Output Format Print a single integer denoting the maximum consecutive 1’s that you can get.

Sample Input 1 0001010

Sample Output 3

Explanation of Sample If we flip the 5th character, we get S = “0001110”, so we have 3 consecutive 1’s present in it.
