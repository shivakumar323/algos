Topic - Array

Advantages of array:
    1. Index based acess - Array is the fastest data structure when you need the index based acess
    2. Contiguous locations - Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations(so it is fastest data structure)
    3. Caching in case array - Since elements are stored in contiguous locations in memory, it will be easy for cpu to cache the array which results in even more efficiency


Disadvantages of array:
    1. Insertions and deletions are expensive
    2. Array needs contiguous memory space

Types of array:
    1. one dimensional array
    2. two dimensional array
    3. multi dimensional array
